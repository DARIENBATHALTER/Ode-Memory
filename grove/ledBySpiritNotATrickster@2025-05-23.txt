[Led by Spirit, not a trickster;]

Bearing humbly this Crystal, which reflects Living Truth.
This seed, “Birthed”, in the sense that it is precipitating from my Love for my son; Love was never mine; but His, shining through.
This is my offering; just the journey which was required to remember myself.
Stones laid, which I pray become well trodden… for the path takes us all Home.
