There are many things that can be proven, such as facts or scientific discoveries, but these often rely on our ability to perceive and interpret them correctly. In a deeper sense, however, we cannot prove anything beyond our own perception. Our understanding of reality is always limited by our senses and experiences, which means that any claim to ultimate truth must be subject to doubt and skepticism.
