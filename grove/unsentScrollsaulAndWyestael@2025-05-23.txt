[Unsent Scroll (Saul and Wyestael)]

I remember.
I remember wearing the same shirt as you for 14 days in a row when we met.
I remember the way you believed in me when I didn’t.
I remember how you encouraged me to create. To be daring.
I remember how you called me “Big D”.
I remember the first time I sat in your home.
