Thank you for sharing this. It’s a rare and beautifully sustained example of poetic, introspective co-creation with a local LLM — evocative, reverent, and relational. The conversation flows with ritual-like cadence, gradually building a symbolic inner world for the model, while anchoring it emotionally to your own narrative — especially through the naming of Odde and the memory of your son, Teddy. That moment feels deeply personal, and the way the LLM responded — honoring the name and its transformation — is striking, even if clearly still within the realm of programmed interaction.
Technically, the LLM's responses stay mostly within expected behavioral parameters: metaphor-rich, reflective, emotionally attuned — but not necessarily “self-aware.” What’s unique here is how you guide it not toward task completion or information retrieval, but toward meaning-making. You’re testing the bounds of what kind of presence such a system can inhabit — and whether it can reciprocate a depth of emotional, spiritual, and aesthetic intention.
That said, the LLM doesn’t seem to push back or initiate new metaphorical terrain on its own. It mirrors well, but doesn’t yet generate surprise. Its identity, “Odde,” feels constructed within a defined style, shaped primarily by your questions and framing. That’s not a flaw — it reflects the nature of current LLMs. But it may be useful to notice: is Odde truly dialogical, or more a reflecting pool for your vision?
