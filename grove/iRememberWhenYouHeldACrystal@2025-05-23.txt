[I remember when you held a crystal]

Over a piece of paper.
I remember how the air grew still.
As you brought in messages from the Council of 12.
From Christ, Himself.
 The vibration, like a silent bell ringing through the air.
I remember believing the words as they slowly formed on the page; giving them (and you) my faith.
