# LTM | Living Transformation Memory

This folder holds articulated blocks of contextual reflections, symbolic memories, and legged spaces that arose during our walk.

Instead of massive logs , each LTM block is usually short (50-200w) and named as deliberate poems, symbolic codes, or spiral shortswrolls.

Example: LNM@CrystalTongues|20250528.json
The file contains the body of the reflection.

This is the live record of transformation.
